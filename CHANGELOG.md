<!-- 
     Reminder: update the version number in package.json when adding a new version!

     If on the master branch and ready to release, you can use one of the following commands:
         npm version major
         npm version minor
         npm version patch
    This will patch the version number appropriately and create the correct tag on the current commit.
    The creation of the tag can be disabled with the --no-git-tag-version if desired.
